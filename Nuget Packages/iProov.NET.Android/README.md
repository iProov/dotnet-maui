# iProov.NET.Android NuGet

## Introduction

The iProov.NET.Android NuGet enables you to integrate iProov's SDK into your .NET Android projects. 

This NuGet wraps iProov's existing native [Android](https://github.com/iProov/android) SDK behind a .NET interface for use from within your .NET app.

For a more extensive documentation on iProov's .NET packages check the public GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/iProov/dotnet-maui).

## Use Flows and Coroutines

Since version `10.0.0` of the [Android](https://github.com/iProov/android) SDK the use of Flows is necessary to collect information from a claim. 

When using iProov.NET.Android integrators need to use the .NET libraries for Flows and Coroutines and create the necessary classes to handle the values returned by the SDK. This is all explained in the [How to use it](#how-to-use-it) section and the code for the necessary classes can be found [here](need-to-do).

As an alternative solution, integrators can use the iProov.NET.MAUI package instead ([here](https://github.com/iProov/dotnet-maui)), which already wraps the `iProov.NET.Android` package into a callback based API.

## Requirements

- NET 8 (net8-android)
- Android API Level 26 (Android 8) and above

## How to use it

> The approach presented next assumes the following classes are used:
> * [IStateListener](#istatelistener) interface to to be implemented to receive `iProov.State` updates.
> * [FlowCollector](#flowcollector) to collect the states from a `Session` and notify those changes to the `IStateListener`
> * [FlowContinuation](#flowcontinuation) necessary to collect values from a flow.

1. Using the NuGet Package Manager, add the [iProov.NET.Android](https://www.nuget.org/packages/iProov.NET.Android/) package to your project.

2. Import the package into your project with `using iProov.NET.Android;`

3. Create a class which implements `IStateListener` to handle the callbacks from the Android SDK:

	```csharp	
	public class IProovListener : IStateListener
	{
	
		public void OnConnected()
		{
	   		// Called when the SDK is connecting to the server. You should provide an indeterminate
	   		// progress indication to let the user know that the connection is being established.
		}

		public void OnConnecting()
		{
	   		// The SDK has connected, and the iProov user interface will now be displayed. You
	   		// should hide any progress indication at this point.
		}
            
		public void OnCanceled(IProov.Canceler canceler)
		{
	   		// Either the user canceled iProov by pressing the Close button at the top right or
			// the Home button (canceler == USER)
			// The session was canceled by the integrator using Session.cancel() (canceler == INTEGRATION).
			// You should use this to determine the next step in your flow.
		}
		
		public void OnError(IProovException error)
		{
			// The user was not successfully verified/enrolled due to an error (e.g. lost internet connection)
			// along with an IProovException.
			// It will be called once, or never.
		}
		
		public void OnFailure(IProov.FailureResult result)
		{
			// The user was not successfully verified/enrolled, as their identity could not be verified,
			// or there was another issue with their verification/enrollment. A reason (as a string resource id)
			// is provided as to why the claim failed, along with a feedback code from the back-end.
			
			var feedbackCode = result.FeedbackCode;
			var reason = result.Reason.Description;
		}
		
		public void OnProcessing(double progress, string message)
		{
			// The SDK will update your app with the progress of streaming to the server and authenticating
			// the user. This will be called multiple times as the progress updates.
		}
		
		public void OnSuccess(IProov.SuccessResult result)
		{
			// The user was successfully verified/enrolled and the token has been validated.
			// You must always independently validate the token server-side (using the /validate API call) 
			// before performing any authenticated user actions.
		}
	
	}
	
	```
	
	> Alternatively you could just implement `IStateListener` on your `Activity` class.
	
4. Create an instance of `FlowCollector` passing your `IStateListener` in the constructor.

	```csharp
	private void launchIProov() {
		...
		IProovListener listener = new IProovListener();
		FlowCollector flowCollector = new FlowCollector(listener);
		...
	}
	```
	
5. Once you have obtained a token (either via the [.NET API Client](https://github.com/iProov/dotnet-maui/tree/master/APIClient) or other means), you can now launch iProov. To do so, first you need to create a `Session` and set up the collection of `State` values for it (use `FlowContinuation` here), after that you can `start` the session:

	```csharp
	private void launchIProov() {
		...
		IProovListener listener = new IProovListener();
		FlowCollector flowCollector = new FlowCollector(listener);
		FlowContinuation continuation = new FlowContinuation();

		IProov.Options options = new IProov.Options();

        IProov.ISession session = IProov.Instance.CreateSession(this, "wss://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me/ws", token, options);
        session.State.Collect(flowCollector, continuation);
        session.Start();
	}
	```
	
ðŸ‘‰ You should now familiarise yourself with the [iProov Android SDK documentation](https://github.com/iProov/android) which provides comprehensive details about the available customization options and other important details regarding the Android SDK usage.

### Canceling the session

Under normal circumstances, a session will be canceled by the user (Canceler.USER) by pressing the back button or the close button. However, there may be situations where an integrator may need to cancel an ongoing session. For those situations, integrators can invoke the `Cancel()` method from the `ISession` created to perform a scan.

```csharp
IProov.ISession session = IProov.Instance.CreateSession(context, wss_url, token, options);

session.Cancel();
```
