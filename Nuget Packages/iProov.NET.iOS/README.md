## Xamarin.iOS

1. Using the NuGet Package Manager, add the [iProov.iOS](https://www.nuget.org/packages/iProov.iOS/) package to your Xamarin project. For further instructions on how to do this, [see here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/nuget-walkthrough?toc=%2Fnuget%2Ftoc.json&view=vsmac-2019#find-and-install-a-package).

2. Add a "Privacy - Camera Usage Description" entry to your Info.plist file with the reason why your app requires camera access (e.g. "To iProov you in order to verify your identity.")

3. Import the package into your project with `using iProov.iOS;`.

4. Once you have obtained a token (either via the .NET API Client or other means), you can launch the iProov iOS SDK as follows:

	```csharp
	IProov.LaunchWithStreamingURL("wss://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me/ws", token, new IPOptions(), // Substitute streaming URL as appropriate
		connecting: () =>
		{
			// The SDK is connecting to the server. You should provide an indeterminate progress indicator
			// to let the user know that the connection is taking place.
		},
		connected: () =>
		{
			// The SDK has connected, and the iProov user interface will now be displayed. You should hide
			// any progress indication at this point.
		},
		processing: (progress, message) =>
		{
			// The SDK will update your app with the progress of streaming to the server and authenticating
			// the user. This will be called multiple time as the progress updates.
		},
		success: (result) =>
		{
			// The user was successfully verified/enrolled and the token has been validated.
			// You can access the following properties:
			var token = result.Token; // The token passed back will be the same as the one passed in to the original call
			var frame = result.Frame; // An optional image containing a single frame of the user, if enabled for your service provider
		},
		canceled: (canceler) =>
		{
			// Either the user canceled iProov by pressing the Close button at the top left or sending
			// the app to the background. (canceler == USER)
			// Or the app canceled using Session.cancel() (canceler == APP).
			// You should use this to determine the next step in your flow.
		},
		failure: (result) =>
		{
			// The user was not successfully verified/enrolled, as their identity could not be verified,
			// or there was another issue with their verification/enrollment. A reason (as a string)
			// is provided as to why the claim failed, along with a feedback code from the back-end.
			var reason = result.Reason
			var description = result.LocalizedDescription;
		},
		error: (error) =>
		{
			// The user was not successfully verified/enrolled due to an error (e.g. lost internet connection).
			// You will be provided with an NSError. You can check the error code against the IPErrorCode constants
			// to determine the type of error.
			// It will be called once, or never.
		}
	);
	```
	
ðŸ‘‰ You should now familiarise yourself with the [iProov iOS SDK documentation](https://github.com/iProov/ios) which provides comprehensive details about the available customization options and other important details regarding the iOS SDK usage.
